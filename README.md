# IMUInitialAlignment

IMUInitialAlignment is a project designed to implement the initial alignment of Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). This system processes IMU data to accurately determine the initial orientation.

## Features

- Processes IMU data for initial alignment
- Implements algorithms for orientation estimation
- Provides a framework for integrating IMU data with alignment systems

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- CMake

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akui1321/IMUInitialAlignment.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd IMUInitialAlignment
3. Build the project using CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

## Usage
- Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./IMUInitialAlignment

The program will start processing IMU data for initial alignment.

## Project Structure
